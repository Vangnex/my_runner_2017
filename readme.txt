 
MY RUNNER HELP SECTION

Welcome to “My Runner”. Made by Didier CHENG thanks to Epitech.

	This game is an auto-scrolling platform game. You can play it with a txt file
	in parameter which should contains '1', '2' or '3' which are respectively 
	platforms at low, middle and high level and must contains at least a '\0'
	to end the map. If you don't enter a map in parameter, you can still play in
	infinite mode where platform are random (The normal mode is locked).

	All enemies spawn randomly and start to appear at certain moments:
	First small enemy start at 5 seconds, Second small at 30 seconds and
	the big enemy start to appear at 60 seconds.
	You have 5 life points and small enemy make 1 point of
	damage. Look out, the big enemy is hard to avoid and instantanly kill.
	The game should not have any problems.

	Here is the command :
	     - Space		= Confirm / Jump (Hold to jump higher)
	     - Left / Right	= Move cursor / Move character
	     - Low + Space 	= Get down of a platform
	     - Enter		= Pause / Resume during pause
	     - Escape		= Pause / Resume during pause / Quit game at title

Good Luck!
